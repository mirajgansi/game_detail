# Game Detail Analysis

## About Me
I am currently learning **data cleaning** and **data modeling** in Python. This repository is part of my practice to improve these skills.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **Game Detail dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). It contains information about various video games, including ratings, user counts, and other game-related metrics.

## Project Overview
- Performed **data cleaning** to handle missing values and ensure consistency.  
- Explored the dataset to understand patterns and trends.  
- Prepared the data for further **analysis and modeling**.  

## Files
- `game_data.csv` – Raw dataset (Game Details)  
- `cleaned_data.csv` – Cleaned dataset after preprocessing  
- Additional scripts for data exploration and cleaning (if any)

## Learning Goals
- Improve **data cleaning** skills  
- Learn **data preprocessing** techniques  
- Practice **data analysis** and modeling workflows
